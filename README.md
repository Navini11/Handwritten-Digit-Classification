üìö Project Overview
The notebook covers the following steps:

Importing Libraries: Load the necessary libraries such as TensorFlow and other dependencies.
Loading Data: Download and prepare the dataset for training and testing.
Building the Model: Define the architecture of the neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API.
Compiling the Model: Specify the loss function, optimizer, and metrics for evaluation.
Training the Model: Train the model on the training dataset.
Evaluating the Model: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
Making Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
üõ†Ô∏è Example
Here's a brief example of what the notebook covers:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
